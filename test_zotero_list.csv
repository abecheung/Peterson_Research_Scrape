The WHO public health approach, which relies on delivery of antiretroviral therapy (ART) by nurses, has enabled a trebling of the number of people receiving ART during the past decade. WHO recognises that HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) can also be provided by nurses; however, many countries still do not have policies in place that support nurse provision of PrEP. In sub-Saharan Africa, most countries allow nurses to prescribe ART, but only a few countries have policies in place that allow nurses to prescribe PrEP. Nurse-led PrEP delivery is particularly low in the Asia-Pacific region, which has some of the world's fastest growing epidemics. Even in many high-income countries, PrEP scale-up has been limited because policies often require medical doctors or specialists to prescribe. Service providers in many countries are coming to realise that scaling up access to PrEP cannot be achieved by medical doctors alone, and nurse-led PrEP delivery can help to lay the groundwork for supporting uptake of other HIV prevention approaches that will become available in the future. Countries with policies that authorise nurses to prescribe ART could be early adopters and help to pave the way for wider adoption of nurse-led PrEP delivery.","2022-05-01","2023-10-01 22:59:37","2023-10-01T22:59:37Z","2023-10-01 22:53:35","e363-e366","","5","9","","The Lancet HIV","Scaling up access to HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To understand the acceptability of PrEP teleconsultation and HIV self-testing, we conducted a web-based study during social distancing period (April–May, 2020) among men who have sex with men and transgender/non-binary individuals using social media. Out of the 2375 HIV negative respondents, 680 reported PrEP use and were included in this analysis. Median age was 33 years (IQR: 28–40), 98% cisgender men, 56% white, 74% high education, and 68% middle/high income. Willingness to use HIVST was 79% and 32% received an HIV self-testing during social distancing period. The majority reported preference for PrEP/HIV self-testing home delivery instead of collecting at the service. PrEP teleconsultation was experienced by 21% and most reported feeling satisfied with the procedures. High acceptability of PrEP teleconsultation was reported by 70%. In ordinal logistic model, having higher education was associated with high aceptability of PrEP teleconsultation (aOR:1.62; 95%CI: 1.07–2.45). Our results point out that PrEP teleconsultation and PrEP/HIV self-testing home delivery could be implemented by PrEP services in Brazil to avoid PrEP shortage during the COVID-19 pandemic and thereafter as an option to increase retention and adherence.","2021-01-01","2023-10-01 22:59:37","2023-10-01T22:59:37Z","2023-10-01 22:53:45","101037","","1","25","","The Brazilian Journal of Infectious Diseases","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Brazil; COVID-19; HIV self-testing; PrEP; Telemedicine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The origin of SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus; the disease evolved as a pandemic public health emergency due to a large spread within most countries, compared to previous coronavirus outbreaks. SARS-CoV-2 mainly infects the upper respiratory tract of the COVID-19 infected patients, causing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Currently, opinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) combination, anti-HIV drug nelfinavir, and chloroquine have been recommended as a treatment protocol for COVID-19 infected patients until a vaccine for COVID-19 is available. Despite the rigorous international control and quarantine efforts, the incidence of COVID-19 cases remains to increase. In response to this pandemic, the existing state of information concerning COVID-19 was summarized in this review.","2020-04-01","2023-10-01 22:49:21","2023-10-01T22:49:21Z","2023-10-01 22:48:34","","","","","","","World Health Organization Declared a Pandemic Public Health Menace","","","","","","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","Social Science Research Network","","","","","","","COVID-19; Pandemic; Quarantine; SARS-CoV-2; World Health Organization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3566298","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This systematic search and review synthesises the evidence on vulnerable migrants living in this region (including but not limited to people with irregular status).  Review findings show that many migrants carry a higher HIV burden than the general population.  Of concern are high proportions of post-migration HIV acquisition (about 40% across various studies), a high risk of remaining undiagnosed or being diagnosed late and challenges in accessing and staying on treatment. Multi-level and intersecting factors were shown to reduce access to HIV services along the HIV continuum of care (PrEP, timely HIV testing, and access to treatment for irregular migrants). Ensuring equitable access to HIV prevention, testing and treatment services for all migrants at increased risk for HIV is needed to meet global targets for ending AIDS by 2030.Funding Information: This study was funded through an Agreement for Performance of Work from UNAIDS (2019/959239/202466139).Declaration of Interests: None declared.","2021-03-30","2023-10-01 22:49:21","2023-10-01T22:49:21Z","2023-10-01 22:42:14","","","","","","","Casting Light on an Underserved Population","","","","","","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","Social Science Research Network","","","","","","","Alyna Smith; Anastasia Pharris; Casting Light on an Underserved Population: Evidence Review of HIV Among Migrants in the EU/EEA; Christiana Nöstlinger; Dominik Zenner; Elena Val; Elena Vovc; Elisabeth Waagensen; Ella Van Landeghem; Henk Van Renterghem; Jantine Jacobi; Jef Vanhamel; Marie Laga; Rosalie Hayes; SSRN; Sarita Sehgal; Teymur Noori; Theo Cosaert","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3815670","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
